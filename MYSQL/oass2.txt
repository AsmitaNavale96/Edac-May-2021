2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
 Ans: RATING

3) What is another word for row? For column?
 Ans:- Row-tuples ,column -attributes

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table
Ans :-1) rows inside the table are not in sequential manner
      2)when you insert into the table whenever it finds the empty 
       space  in the DB server HD,it will strore the row there
      3)the reason is the RDMS does this is to speed up the insert
      statement.
      4)when you select from a table the order of output depends on
      the row address (searching is always sequential)
      5)when you select from the table, the order of row in the 
      output will be always in ascending order of row address
      6)whwn you update a row,if the row length is increasing the 
       row address may change(its only in the case of varchar that the row  length may increase).
       hence its not possible to see the first 'N' rows inserted in a table.
